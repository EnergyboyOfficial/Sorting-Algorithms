# Sorting-Algorithms
This Python code demonstrates all sorts of algorithms that can be used as examples + Explanation.

Linear Search (linear_search function):
It searches for a specific element e in a list l using a linear search algorithm. If the element is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of e in the list. If the element is not found in the list, it returns -1.

Binary Search (binary_search function):
It searches for a specific element e in a sorted list l using a binary search algorithm. Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm for sorted lists. If the element is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of e in the sorted list. If the element is not found in the list, it returns -1.

Selection Sort (selection_sort function):
It takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements of l sorted in ascending order. Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the list and places it at the end of the sorted portion of the list.

Insertion Sort (insertion_sort function):
It takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements of l sorted in ascending order. Insertion sort is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the final sorted list one item at a time, by iterating through the input list and inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted list.

Merge Sort (merge_sort function):
It takes a list l as input and returns a new list with elements of l sorted in ascending order. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce the final sorted list.

The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use each of these functions on a sample list sample_list. You can replace sample_list with any list of integers and observe the results of different algorithms. For instance, you can try searching for a specific element or sorting a different list using these algorithms.
